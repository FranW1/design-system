## When to use this component

Use the secondary button for actions that aren't the primary action to be taken on a page.

## When not to use this component

If there is a primary action to be taken, use the primary button. If the primary user need is to perform other tasks (like view information) then it's better to use a standard link style.

## How it works

Write the button text in sentence case, describing the action it performs. For example ‘Add questions’ or ‘List for hearing’.
