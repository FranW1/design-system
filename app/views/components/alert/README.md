Use the Alert component to tell users that something has happened in response to an action.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'alert',

})}}

## When to use this component

Use this component for internal systems where the user performs the same action frequently. For example, when a judge creates a number of questions in a batch before sending them to the citizen.

## When not to use this component

You should not use this pattern for citizen facing journeys or internal processes that have a signficant impact such as making decisions. For these cases you should use [Confirmation Page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages/) pattern.
