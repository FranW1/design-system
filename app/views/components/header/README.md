Use the Header component for services that are not hosted on GOV.UK.

  name: 'header',

## When to use this component

Use this header component for services that are not hosted on GOV.UK.  For example, services used by judiciary or HMCTS staff.

Do not use this for citizen-facing services.

## How it works

The service or system name is displayed in the black bar.  Global navigation options can be added as links to the right hand side of the black bar.  Sign out is a global navigation option.

If more than 3 global navigation options are identified, the links would change to be incorporated into a single drop-down list.
