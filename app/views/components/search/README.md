Use the Search component to let users search for something.

This component can also be used in combination with the [Primary Navigation](/components/primary-navigation) component.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'search',
  example: 'default',
  height: 200
})}}

## How it works

You can configure the search form to be inversed on black and to hide and show labels and hints depending on your use case. You'll see examples of this on the [Primary Navigation](/components/primary-navigation) component page.
