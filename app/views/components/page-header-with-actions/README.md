Use the Page Header With Actions component when there are page-level actions that user can take and you want to position them inline with the heading (h1).

{{dsExample({
  name: 'page-header-with-actions',
  example: 'default',
  height: 175
})}}

## When not to use this component

Don't place buttons next to the header when they are specific to a component within the page.
