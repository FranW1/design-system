  example: 'default',
  height: 175
})}}

## When to use this component

## When not to use this component

Don't use this component when a basic in-page form has multiple actions.

## How it works

By default this component just groups buttons together to ensure they are spaced correctly. But you can turn it into a toggle menu at particular screen size which is useful when the buttons can't fit on the screen comfortably.

### Grey toggle menu

This menu is aligned left and is in the secondary colour because there are other more important actions the user needs to take.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible',
  height: 250
})}}

### Green toggle menu

This menu is aligned right and is in the primary colour because selecting an action from the menu is the primary user need.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible2',
  height: 250
})}}
