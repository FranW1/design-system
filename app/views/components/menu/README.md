But it can be configured to collapse into a toggle menu at a particular screen size. This is useful when you have a number of options that can't fit on screen.

### Collapsible menu

This menu is in the grey secondary colour.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible',
  height: 250
})}}

### Collapsible menu

This menu is in the green primary colour and aligned right.

{{dsExample({
  name: 'menu',
  example: 'collapsible2',
  height: 250
})}}
