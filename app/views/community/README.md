# Community

The HMCTS Design System is for everyone. It brings together the latest research, design and development from across HMCTS teams to make sure it’s representative and relevant for its users.

Find out [how to contribute](how-you-can-contribute), or see what people are currently working on in the [community backlog](backlog).

You can also learn how the cross-government [Design System working group](design-system-working-group) helps to ensure the components and patterns you’ll find here meet the [contribution criteria](contribution-criteria).
